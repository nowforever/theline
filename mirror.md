- I am a man born to the late eighties.
- I remember using the paint program on my parents Apple 2

- When I was young dad accidentally stole a man's parking space. The man got out and yelled "you're nothing but a {forgotten} white man". It is my first memory of white privilege.
- I've come to *begin* to understand the poison of a culture that marginalizes people.
- I've hurt people I loved because I was selfish. 
 - I don't *really* know how to repent for my sins.
